The syntax of using brackets and commas in Python import statements is interchangeable and does not affect the behavior of the import. 
Both `from utils_docvqa import read_docvqa_examples, convert_examples_to_features` and 
`from utils_docvqa import (read_docvqa_examples, convert_examples_to_features)` 

are valid and equivalent ways to import multiple names from a module.

Using brackets can sometimes make the code easier to read, especially if you're importing many names from a module on a single line,
because it helps to visually group the names together. However, if you're only importing a few names, or if you prefer to use commas,
you can do so without any issues.

In the statement **from transformers.data.processors.squad import SquadV1Processor**, the dot (.) is used to access a nested module or 
sub-package within the transformers package.

In Python, a package is a way to organize related modules into a directory hierarchy. A package can contain sub-packages, which are simply
other directories that also contain Python modules, as well as other resources such as configuration files or data files.

So in this case, **transformers** is a package that contains sub-packages such as **data**, which in turn contains sub-packages such as **processors**, 
which finally contains the squad module.

The **SquadV1Processor** class is defined in the **squad module**, and the dot notation is used to specify its location within the package hierarchy,
so that it can be imported and used in other parts of the code.

It's worth noting that transformers is not a class, but a package that contains classes, functions, and other resources.
